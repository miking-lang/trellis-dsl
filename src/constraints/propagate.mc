-- Performs propagation of constraints relating a component of the from-state
-- to a component of the to-state (EqYPlusNum), by adding inequality
-- constraints on the to-state component. For instance, if we have a constraint
--
--   x[2] = y[2] - 1
--
-- we know y[2] = 0 is invalid, because it results in x[2] = -1, which is
-- outside the range of that component (we assume all ranges are normalized
-- to lower bound zero). The propagation defined in this file adds inequality
-- constraints (y[2] != 0 in the above example) such that all constraints on
-- the components of the to-state are stored in the set of the corresponding
-- component, rather than implicitly in a constraint on a from-state component.
--
-- In addition, we propagate any equality or inequality constraints on a
-- from-state components to any components of the to-state which are related
-- via a constraint.
--
-- This propagation opens up for two important optimizations in the compiler.
-- First, it enables us to immediately rule out invalid to-state values in the
-- "outer" conditional, rather than having to generate components of the
-- from-state (predecessor state) to rule it out. Second, it enables easily
-- determining whether a selection of sets of constraints covers all possible
-- to-states - this may allow us to combine conditional code for multiple
-- cases (very important for performance in CUDA), and also to compute a more
-- accurate upper bound on the maximum number of predecessors.
